This is my project on creating Contact Us Page using PHP and MySQL.
In this project I have created a contact form which consists of Name,phone number,email,subject
and message they want to send.
This information can be viewed by the admin.
So I have created admin page in which dashboard contains the contacts that send messages
We can also get notifications that we received some message so that we can report back to them
There is also an option to edit admin's profile 
 


How to run my contact form

1. Download the the zip file
2. Extract the file and copy contactform folder
3.Paste inside root directory(for xampp xamp/htdocs, for wampp/www,fpr lamp var/www/html)
